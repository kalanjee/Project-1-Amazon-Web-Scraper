# Description #

If you, like me are thinking of selling a product on amazon, you may want to keep track of the competition. While there are ready made APIs out there to do this, I decided to build a simple one that can be run as and when you want to. 

# Usage #

* Please be sure to enter a User Agent. If you need help, go to this URL: https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent/ 
* Please be sure to enter a URL. The simplest way to do this is to go to Amazon and type in a product into search. 
* Note that the code has been configured for amazon.co.uk. If you are in another country, check and replace any instances of co.uk with what you need. 
* Note that the code has been configured to pull data from product pages for alcohol on amazon.co.uk. Product pages for other categories may have different HTML elements - if in doubt, check.

Credit to Darshil Parmar for his great tutorial on how to put this together. Please watch, like and subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hPCX-p_X8Q. I followed his steps and built this out using Jupyter notebooks and then swapped over to VSC.
